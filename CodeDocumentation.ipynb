        "# 1. Upload more photos of the person to be customized to **improve ID fidelty**. If the input is Asian face(s), maybe consider adding 'asian' before the class word, e.g., `asian woman img`\n",
        "# 2. When stylizing, does the generated face look too realistic? Adjust the **Style strength** to 30-50, the larger the number, the less ID fidelty, but the stylization ability will be better.\n",
        "# 3. If you want to generate realistic photos, you could try switching to our other gradio application [PhotoMaker](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TencentARC/PhotoMaker).\n",
        "# 4. For **faster** speed, reduce the number of generated images and sampling steps. However, please note that reducing the sampling steps may compromise the ID fidelity.\n",
