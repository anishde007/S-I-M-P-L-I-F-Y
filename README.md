# LLM Summarizer Project

overview:
  description: |
    This project is a Language Model (LLM) Summarizer that utilizes the power of
    Hugging Face's Transformers library to generate summaries from given text content.
    The application is designed to simplify the summarization process, making it easy
    for users to generate concise summaries for large volumes of text.

getting_started:
  steps:
    - create_virtual_environment: |
        <h2>Create a virtual environment in Python using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)</h2>
        to manage project dependencies.
    - install_dependencies: |
        <h2>Run the following command to install the required packages from the `requirements.txt` file:</h2>
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    - set_huggingface_api_token: |
        <h2>Obtain your Hugging Face API token from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/).</h2>
        <h2>Set the `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN` environment variable with your Hugging Face API key.</h2>
        <p>Also, ensure that the `api` variable in the code matches your key.</p>

    - run_application: |
        <h2>Execute the main script using the following command:</h2>
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```

    - customization: |
        <h2>Modify the PDF file and query directly in the code to test the summarization with different content.</h2>

notes:
  - <h2>Ensure that your virtual environment is activated before running the application.</h2>
  - <h2>It's recommended to use a dedicated virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects.</h2>
